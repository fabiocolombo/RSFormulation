RobotSkinExact: (Solve the Robot Skin problem using Exact Approaches)
You can run the script exec.sh in RobotSkinExact folder as follow:
sh exec.sh ../newInput/test18.dat ROOT_MINIMIZATION_CONSTRAINTS
The first argument is the input file
The other arguments are possibile formulation extensions:
-ROOT_MINIMIZATION_CONSTRAINTS: constraints to impose the minimum node as root in each cluster
-ORBITOPE_POLYNOMIAL: constraints to break symmetry in cluster permutations (only the polynomial version)
-EXPONENTIAL_POLYNOMIAL: constraints to break symmetry in cluster permutations (the exponentail version). Not ALREADY implemented.
-PFILTER: constraints to put y_ij^k=0 if two nodes cannot be in the same cluster due to maximum cluster siz is the input file
